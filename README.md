Wasup, my name is Bruno

I'm a computer science student at "Unifavip Wyden" college.

I'm currently studying JavaScript, Phyton and C. My future objective is to get "in-depth" learning about databases.

Also, I'm a noob, so if you can help me out to improve my code or help me to learn something new, I would really appreciate it (:
